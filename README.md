# Neuropixels Platform Paper

<img src="icon.png" width="48">

This repository contains code for generating the figures in the pre-print describing the scientific findings from the Allen Institute's [Neuropixels data collection platform](https://portal.brain-map.org/explore/circuits/visual-coding-neuropixels).

Most of the figures can be generated from publicly available NWB files and unit tables, available via the AllenSDK. See [the AllenSDK documentation](https://allensdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/visual_coding_neuropixels.html) for an overview of the dataset and example notebooks for accessing it.

Each figure in the pre-print has a folder with associated code. Data required for figure generation that's not available in the October 2019 release (e.g., from the change detection experiments) is included in the `data` directory.

This repository is still a work in progress; we will continue to clean up the code and add documentation throughout the review process.
